/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for ExpenseWise.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user has exclusive access to their
 * profile data, transactions, categories, budgets, and monthly summaries. No cross-user access is permitted.
 * A user document MUST exist in the /users collection for any data access to be granted.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under `/users/{userId}`, ensuring clear ownership and simplified security rules.
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/transactions/{transactionId}: Stores individual transaction records.
 * - /users/{userId}/categories/{categoryId}: Stores expense categories.
 * - /users/{userId}/budgets/{budgetId}: Stores budget information.
 * - /users/{userId}/monthlySummaries/{monthlySummaryId}: Stores monthly financial summaries.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - No listing of all users is allowed.
 * - All write operations require authentication.
 * - Data consistency between the path and document data is enforced on both creation and update, protecting against unauthorized data manipulation.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The 'userId' is denormalized into each transaction, category, budget, and monthlySummary document to allow direct authorization checks without additional reads.
