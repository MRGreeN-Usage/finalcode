/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for ExpenseWise.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user has exclusive access to their
 * profile data, transactions, categories, and monthly summaries. No cross-user access is permitted.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under `/users/{userId}`, ensuring clear ownership and simplified security rules.
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/transactions/{transactionId}: Stores individual transaction records.
 * - /users/{userId}/categories/{categoryId}: Stores expense categories.
 * - /users/{userId}/monthlySummaries/{monthlySummaryId}: Stores monthly financial summaries.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - No listing of all users is allowed.
 * - All write operations require authentication.
 * - Ownership is strictly enforced by matching the `userId` in the path to the requester's `auth.uid`.
